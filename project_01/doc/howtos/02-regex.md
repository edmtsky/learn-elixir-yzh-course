how to convert regex from lua to elixir
input
"[DEV] some description - 1h 2m"

lua regex:
string.match(line, '^\[(%w)\]%s(.-)%-([^%-]+)$')

so i can get this list of strings:
["DEV", "some description", "1h 2m"]

To convert the Lua regex to Elixir and match the input string
`"[DEV] some description - 1h 2m"`, we
need to adapt the pattern to the Elixir regex syntax,
which has some differences compared to Lua.

The Lua regex pattern you provided is:
```
'^\[(%w+)%]%s(.-)%-([^%-]+)$'
```

Here's how it can be translated to Elixir:

1. The character class `%w` in Lua matches a word character (letters, numbers,
and underscores). In Elixir, we can use `\w` for the same purpose, but since
we're matching a sequence of words, we would need to use `+` to indicate one or
more.
2. The Lua `%s` matches whitespace, which can be translated to `\s` in Elixir.
3. The `(.-)` captures the smallest possible sequence of characters
(non-greedy). In Elixir, this can be represented by `(.+?)` for non-greedy
matching.
4. The `%-` in Lua represents a literal hyphen and a space, which can be simply
` -` in Elixir.
5. The `([^%-]+)` captures everything that is not a hyphen in Elixir it will
become `([^-]+)`.

The final Elixir regex would look like this:

```elixir
~r/^\[(\w+)\]\s(.+?) - ([^-]+)$/
```

Now, you can use this regex to match against your input string and capture the
desired groups:

```elixir
input = "[DEV] some description - 1h 2m"
regex = ~r/^\[(\w+)\]\s(.+?) - ([^-]+)$/

case Regex.run(regex, input) do
  [_, group1, group2, group3] ->
    [group1, group2, group3]
  _ ->
    {:error, "No match"}
end
```

### Explanation of the code:
- `Regex.run/2` attempts to match the regex against the input string. It
returns a list where the first element is the entire matched string, followed
by the captured groups.
- We use pattern matching (`[_, group1, group2, group3]`) to extract the
captured groups.
- We return a list of the captures in the required format. If there is no match,
 we return an error tuple.

### Output:
For the input `"[DEV] some description - 1h 2m"`, this code will output:
```elixir
["DEV", "some description", "1h 2m"]
```
