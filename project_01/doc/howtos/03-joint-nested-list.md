elixir:
how to join list of lines into string?

```elixir
["line1", ["line2", "line3"], "line4"]
```

to get this string:

"line1\nline2\nline3\nline4"

To join a nested list of strings into a single string with new line characters
in Elixir, you can use recursion or list comprehensions to flatten the list
first and then use `Enum.join/2` to concatenate them. Here's how you can
achieve that:

1. First, you need to flatten the list.
2. Then, join the flattened list with newline characters.

Here's a simple implementation:

```elixir
defmodule LineJoiner do
  def join_lines(lines) do
    lines
    |> flatten_list()
    |> Enum.join("\n")
  end

  defp flatten_list(list) do
    Enum.flat_map(list, fn
      sublist when is_list(sublist) -> flatten_list(sublist)
      item -> [item]
    end)
  end
end

# Example usage:
lines = ["line1", ["line2", "line3"], "line4"]
result = LineJoiner.join_lines(lines)
IO.puts(result)  # Outputs: line1\nline2\nline3\nline4
```

### Explanation:

1. **`join_lines/1`**: This function takes a list of lines, flattens it, and
joins it with `\n`.
2. **`flatten_list/1`**: This private function recursively flattens the list.
It uses `Enum.flat_map/2`, which traverses the list:
   - If the element is a list (`sublist`), it recursively flattens it.
   - If it's not a list, it returns the item in a single-element list.

When you run this code with the given input, it outputs the desired string
format.
